## Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account
*Here's a [website](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to a simple guide*

#### Using GitHub.com
1. Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard.

*If your SSH public key file has a different name than the example code, modify the filename to match your current setup. When copying your key, don't add any newlines or whitespace.*

```bash
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Then select and copy the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file
# displayed in the terminal to your clipboard
```
